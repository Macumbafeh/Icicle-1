# Icicle TBC Addon (forked from Schaka)

This addon shows enemy CDs on their nameplates.

This is a slightly improved version of (https://github.com/Schaka/Icicle).
The goal is to make it more reliant on clearing it's own icons.
Later the iconcreation module will be rewritten, to reuse iconframes instead of creating more and more.

You can create testicons with `/icicletest unitname` where `unitname` is the name of an hostile nameplate.

This is compatible with 
- https://github.com/XiconQoo/XiconPlateBuffs
- https://github.com/sativahigh/SoHighPlates
- https://github.com/shagu/ShaguPlates/
- Aloft
